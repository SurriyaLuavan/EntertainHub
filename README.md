## **What I Learned**

While working on EntertainHub, I gained experience in developing a responsive web application with a modern and intuitive interface. I also had the opportunity to work with several technologies and libraries that have expanded my skillset as a developer.

Some of the key takeaways from this project include:

- React hooks, such as useContext, useEffect, and useRef, which helped me to manage state, handle side effects, and access DOM elements more efficiently.
- Next.js, a framework for building server-rendered React applications, which allowed me to create a highly performant and SEO-friendly application with minimal setup and configuration.
- Firebase, a cloud-based platform that provides authentication and database services, which enabled me to build a secure and scalable backend for EntertainHub.
- Formik and Yup, two libraries that made it easy to create forms with input validation and error handling, and helped me to streamline the user input process.
- MUI, a UI library for React, which provided pre-built components and styles that enabled me to create a cohesive and visually appealing interface.

Through this project, I was able to demonstrate my proficiency in React and showcase my ability to develop a full-stack web application using various frontend and backend technologies. I also gained experience in working with Git, linting tools, and other development tools that are essential for building robust and maintainable applications.

## **Roadmap for Future Development**

Some potential features that will be added in the future include:

- Integration with a movie or TV show API, such as the Open Movie Database (OMDb) or The Movie Database (TMDb), to fetch and display data dynamically for each show.
- Implementing dynamic routing, which would allow users to access more detailed information about each movie or TV show by clicking on a link or button within the application.
- Adding more advanced search capabilities, such as filters for genre, release year, or rating, to help users find exactly what they're looking for.
